# Ads_Blocker_Chrome_extension

* It Stops Ads while playing any video on youtube.
On the first launch of chrome and playing any 1st video on youtube will show ads. But after that, the video ads will be stopped and will not be shown on any new/other video play.


# Installation 
[] Go to chrome extension setting.
[] Enable Developer settings.
[] Tap on Unpacked Extension(left top bar).
[] Direct the path to this download repo. folder.
[] All Done. You'll see a new chrome extension is now enabled and ready to work.


Feel free to contribute.
Of course, you're also irritated by the advertisement.
